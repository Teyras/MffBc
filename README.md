# Bachelor's thesis sandbox

This repository contains a couple of template files (by Martin Mare≈°) for 
Bachelor theses at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University. 
Because writing long text sections in LaTeX can be cumbersome, the Makefile 
allows using Markdown.

## Usage

- install pandoc, pandoc-citeproc, pdflatex, bibtex
- write your thesis
	- fill in information about the thesis in `metadata.tex`
	- put new chapters in the `chapters` directory
	- list the chapters in the `CHAPTERS` variable in the Makefile
	- list any cited resources in `literature.bib`
- run `make`
